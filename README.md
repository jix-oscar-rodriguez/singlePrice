Hi, I hope you're ok :3

Today I show you another of the things I did to practice, the design of the page is in front mentor, this is just the way I did it

You can modify this code, use it and you can even take my template to use it for profit but remember to give me the credits

Something you should keep in mind is that I couldn't install the specific text font so I apologize ðŸ˜¢

If you want to contact me to do some work or you want to give me a hand to improve as a future frontend programmer, you can write me by telegram at the following ID: lumine098
